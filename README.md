Some of this datasets showed inconsistency in data types, missing information, duplicated records among others and had to be cleaned prior to perfoming EDA. After analysis, the following visualizations were generated;

## CONCLUSION

1.The company should invest more in the following genres as they generate more income for a long period of time:
- Action and superhero films
- Documentaries
2.The company should focus more on films that are relatable internationally. This is evident as top perfoming movies do well internationally than domestically, in terms of net gross.
3.The company can invest in superhero merchandise as an extra income source mostly targeting children.
